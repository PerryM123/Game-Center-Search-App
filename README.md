## Personal Milestones 

### Closer to reach:

* Integrate testing (Jest)
* Prepping JSON data to be loaded into the app successfully (internally or externally)
* Google Maps integration with Pins
* Get a handle on transitioning between components cleaning
* Have a nice gradient and color when designing app

### Harder to reach:

* Integrating Firebase/MangoDB
* Lazy Loading Components and Images
