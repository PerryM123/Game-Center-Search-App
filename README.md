# Game-Center-Search-App
I love fighting games. I created this app to help me and others find the best fighting game arcades to go to in Tokyo.

## Personal Milestones

### Closer to reach:

* Integrate testing (Jest)
* Prepping JSON data to be loaded into the app successfully (internally or externally)
* Google Maps integration with Pins
* Get a handle on transitioning between components cleanly
* Have a nice gradient design and color when designing app

### Harder to reach:

* Integrating Firebase/MangoDB (to learn how to handle things like "isLoggedIn()")
* Lazy Loading Components and Images
